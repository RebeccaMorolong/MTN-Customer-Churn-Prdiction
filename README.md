# MTN Customer Churn Analysis

## 📈 Business Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and identify key factors influencing customer churn for MTN. By leveraging data-driven insights, the objective is to predict which customers are at risk of leaving and develop targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty, reduce churn rates, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. This will help MTN optimize customer acquisition costs, increase revenue, and maintain a competitive edge in the telecommunications industry.
